# Audit Report Format, Error Messages, Observability

## Audit Report Format

```markdown
## TODOS.md Audit Report

Schema version: 2.0
Scanned: TODOS.md (N entries), TODOS-archive.md (M entries)
ID range: 1-max_id

Issues found: K
- TODO-X: Missing required field **Decisions:**
- TODO-Y: Invalid dependency reference `TODO-Z` (not found)
- TODO-W: Status marker `[->]` — expected `[→]`

ID gap check: OK (max=23, counter=23)
```

Report only — no automatic fixes.

## Error Messages

### T8 convention: Path + remediation verb

Each error message **names the absolute file path** and a one-line action verb. Examples:

```
Error: /path/to/TODOS.md does not exist.
Remediation: Create the file or run `todos-manager --init`.

Error: Title must be 10–200 characters.
Remediation: Edit your input and re-enter the title.

Error: **What:** field is empty.
Remediation: Describe what needs to be done (required).

Error: **Why:** field must be 10–200 characters.
Remediation: Provide a rationale for why this task matters.

Error: **Decisions:** field is missing.
Remediation: Set key decisions: Priority, Effort, Phase, Branch, Test Coverage, Security Review.

Error: Dependency TODO-99 does not exist in TODOS.md or TODOS-archive.md.
Remediation: Check the list of valid IDs or remove TODO-99 from the depends_on list.

Error: Status marker "[->]" is not recognized.
Remediation: Use one of: [ ] pending, [→] in progress, [x] done, [~] on hold.
```

### Error & Rescue Map

| Error | Root Cause | Remediation |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| TODOS.md not found | First-run on new project | Run `todos-manager --init` |
