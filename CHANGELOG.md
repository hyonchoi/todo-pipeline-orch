# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **`--verbose` / `--debug` logging flags** — `--verbose` increases log detail (selection results, lock state, tick_id). `--debug` enables full debug logging (agent call summaries, circuit breaker transitions, kanban registration)
- **`recover-counter` subcommand** — scans `TODOS.md` for the highest `TODO-N` ID and initializes `.hermes/todo_id_counter`; prevents ID collisions when bootstrapping a project with hand-written TODOs

### Fixed
- **`--debug` flag now enables `pipeline.verbose` logger** — verbose log lines are now visible in debug mode (they were previously only shown with `--verbose`)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Multi-project scan loop** — `pipeline-watch tick` without a project argument now scans all active projects in `projects_dir`, running one selection per project under a single global lock. `pipeline-watch kill` without a project argument similarly scans all projects
- **Per-project configuration** — `<project>/.hermes/project.toml` for filtering (`enabled = false` to archive) and per-project Slack channel via `[notifications] slack_channel`
- **Project discovery** — new `project_config` module with `_discover_projects()`, `_is_enabled()`, and `_resolve_slack_channel()` for filesystem-based project filtering

### Changed
- **Selection model default** — `SelectionConfig.model` defaults to `"auto"` instead of `"claude-opus-4-7"`. Hermes resolves `"auto"` to the current best model, so the pipeline stays current without reconfiguring.
- **`tick` subcommand** — optional `project` argument; when omitted, scans all active projects instead of requiring a specific project
- **`kill` subcommand** — optional `project` argument; when omitted, scans all projects for in-flight phases
- **State migration** — first-run migration of global state (`~/.hermes/`) to per-project state (`<project>/.hermes/`) via new `state_migration` module

### Fixed
- **Kill across projects** — `kill --todo` now searches all project state directories for the specified TODO, returns exit code 2 if not found anywhere
- **Slug validation** — `_validate_project_slug` rejects single-character slugs and invalid directory names during project discovery, preventing misconfigured projects from entering the scan loop

### Removed
- **Circuit breaker cron backoff** — The circuit breaker no longer adjusts the Hermes cron interval (backoff/resume). `backoff_interval_min` and `backed_off` are removed from config and circuit state. The gateway service owns tick scheduling.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **`pipeline-watch tick` subcommand** — kanban-as-scheduler pipeline tick: selects a TODO via Hermes agent, registers phases as kanban tasks with `--parent` dependency chain, and observes circuit breaker
- **Kanban task registration** — `register_todo_phases` creates phases as kanban tasks with `--idempotency-key` for dedup and `--parent` for sequential execution
- **Circuit breaker outcome observation** — `observe_outcomes` writes phase completion/failure outcomes to JSONL sidecars; `observe_from_outcomes` reads outcomes to drive circuit breaker state
- **Stale-marker PID verification** — `_phase_started_ids` checks process liveness before sweeping stale markers; wedged-but-alive processes remain visible
- **Kanban-aware in-flight detection** — `build_in_flight` queries kanban for in-flight tasks, falls back to file markers
- **`.hermes/prompts/` tracking** — prompt templates are tracked in git; runtime state (decisions, outcomes, locks) is ignored

### Changed
- **Tutorial updated** — `pipeline-watch tick` is the primary workflow for development and debugging; Hermes cron is optional for production

### Fixed
- **Circuit breaker config loaded once per tick** — eliminated duplicate TOML overlay reads and `CircuitBreaker` instantiations
- **Project slug validation** — rejects path traversal (`..`, `.`) and CLI flag injection (`--help`, `-v`) in project slugs
- **Partial registration detection** — expected phase keys are now persisted after kanban task registration; `all_phases_complete` verifies all expected phases are present before returning true
- **Tick stall detection** — `tick_started` sentinel without terminal outcomes is now treated as a stall (not completion) so the circuit breaker can detect no-progress conditions
- **Hermes kanban CLI adaptation** — adapted to CLI drift: `--board` → `--tenant`, positional title
- **Atomic tick_id persistence** — tick_id is persisted atomically and before kanban registration, preventing split-brain on crash

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Initial release: `pipeline-watch` CLI with auto-tick, merge, and status commands
- Auto-tick discovery: scans projects for TODOS.md changes and selects eligible TODOs
- Phase 9 merge orchestration: confirm, version bump, and git merge to main
- Cron registration: `install-cron.sh` helper for 5-minute automated ticks
- CLI subcommands: `auto`, `merge`, `status`
- Pending records table showing ready-for-review records with status and age
- Configuration via environment variables: `PIPELINE_LOCK_DIR`, `PIPELINE_PROJECTS_DIR`, etc.

### Fixed
- Improved error messages for invalid arguments (e.g., non-numeric `todo_id`)

### Changed
- Updated Python version requirement from >=3.14 to >=3.9 for broader compatibility

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Hermes decision engine** — LLM-driven selection replaces deterministic selection (`decision/` module with context builder, agent, schema, store)
- **SHA-pinned prompts** — prompts stored with SHA-256 checksums; mismatch alerts at selection time
- **Injection fences** — fence-tag injection neutralized in untrusted regions of the decision pipeline
- **Immutable decisions + sidecar outcomes** — write-once via `os.link`, per-writer UUID temp files, rotation of stale records
- **Circuit breaker** — no-progress counter, cron backoff, Slack alert deduplication
- **Atomic tick lock** — atomic-mkdir `tick.lock` with stale sweep; prevents duplicate ticks
- **Phase markers** — `phase_started` marker write/delete around invocation; exclusive markers prevent double-run
- **Kill subcommand** — `pipeline-watch kill --todo TODO-N` or `--all` for in-flight phases; confirms process exit, releases tick lock when owned
- **Outcome sidecar** — terminal `merge_status` transitions write outcome metadata (failed, killed_by_operator)
- **Eval suite** — 8 selection-prompt fixtures with runner (`tests/eval/`); non-blocking eval workflow
- **Operator how-to guides** — Diataxis-formatted guides for config, eval, kill, and prompt-sha-mismatch troubleshooting
- **Hermes state machine** — docs for phase lifecycle (state machine table)

### Changed
- **Directory structure flattened** — `hermes-pipeline/src/hermes_pipeline/` → `hermes_pipeline/`; `hermes-pipeline/tests/` → `tests/`; `hermes-pipeline/configs/` → `configs/`
- **Raised minimum Python version** from >=3.9 to >=3.12
- **Decision-driven pipeline** — watcher and CLI pruned to delegate selection and scheduling to Hermes

### Fixed
- **Hallucinated picks rejected** — LLM must pick a TODO that exists in TODOS.md; rejects hallucinated IDs
- **Atomic state writes** — `set_merge_status` and `ready_for_review` use tmp+rename to prevent partial writes
- **Best-effort outcome sidecar** — `set_merge_status` doesn't fail if sidecar write fails
- **Config path resolution** — phases resolve config relative to flattened directory structure
- **Kill targets `child_pid`** — kill subcommand targets the phase child process, not the watcher
- **Canonical RFR filename** — decision context normalizes filename and checks PID liveness on sweep

### Removed
- **Deterministic `selection.py`** — replaced by Hermes LLM-driven decision engine
- **`pipeline-watch auto` subcommand** — scheduling moved to Hermes cron (`hermes cron set pipeline-tick */5 * * * *`)
- **System crontab registration** — `install-cron.sh` removed; tick schedule managed via `hermes cron set`
- **Redundant `hermes-pipeline/README.md`** — documentation consolidated in root docs

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Hermes adapter** — `hermes_pipeline/hermes_adapter.py` with `hermes_call()` (simple one-shot queries) and `hermes_agent_call()` (agent-style subprocess with PID tracking). All LLM traffic now routes through `hermes chat -q` instead of direct Anthropic SDK calls.
- **HermesCallError and HermesAgentResult** — structured error and result types for Hermes CLI failures and agent outcomes.
- **.env file support** — `.env` files are now git-ignored (`.env.example` is allowed).
- **CI action pinning** — GitHub Actions pinned to SHA hashes for supply-chain security.

### Changed
- **Decision agent** — `_anthropic_call()` replaced with `_hermes_call()`; no longer imports the `anthropic` package. Timeout is computed from `max_tokens` (1s per 100 tokens, min 30s, max 300s).
- **Phase execution** — `_run_claude_subprocess()` replaced with `hermes_agent_call()`. Tool and turn constraints are now encoded as prompt headers since `hermes chat -q` lacks `--tools`/`--turns` flags.
- **Requirements** — Anthropic API key is no longer needed for runtime selection (eval suite still checks for it as a skip gate). Hermes CLI must be installed and authenticated (`hermes login`) instead.

### Removed
- **Anthropic SDK dependency** — `anthropic>=0.40` removed from `pyproject.toml`. The orchestrator no longer calls the Anthropic API directly.

### Fixed
- **Process group kill on timeout** — `hermes_agent_call()` kills the entire process group (hermes + children) on timeout instead of only the parent process, preventing orphaned subprocesses.
- **stderr capture on agent timeout** — after SIGKILL, agent timeout path now captures stderr for diagnostics.
- **Transient spawn retry** — `hermes_call()` and `hermes_agent_call()` retry up to 2 times on transient OSError before failing, improving resilience against brief network hiccups.
- **KeyboardInterrupt propagation** — `hermes_agent_call()` propagates KeyboardInterrupt instead of silently swallowing it during timeout handling.
- **Tool enforcement via CLI flags** — tool and turn constraints are enforced via `hermes chat -q` CLI flags (`-t` for tools, `--max-turns` for turns) instead of purely advisory prompt headers.
- **Preflight hermes check** — `check_hermes()` validates the hermes CLI availability before pipeline operations, failing fast with a clear error.
- **Renamed claude functions** — `_anthropic_call()` and `_run_claude_subprocess()` renamed to `_hermes_call()` and `_run_hermes_subprocess()` to reflect the new dependency.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Ship gate (Phase 9)** — New `phase_9_ship` blocked kanban task that holds every completed TODO in-flight until a human approves via `pipeline-watch approve`. The blocked gate replaces the `terminal: true` flag on Phase 8, keeping the pipeline loop running until approval.
- **`pipeline-watch approve` subcommand** — Deterministically ships an approved TODO: bumps VERSION/pyproject.toml/CHANGELOG on the work branch, gates on CI-green, and squash-merges to main with `--match-head-commit`. Idempotent — re-running on an already-merged PR just completes the gate.
- **SHA-staleness guard** — Refuses to merge if the PR head SHA has changed since review. `--force --force` (double pass) bypasses this guard and writes an audit log entry.
- **Dirty-tree and CI-green guards** — Refuses approve if the working tree is dirty or CI is not green. Force flag never bypasses these guards.
- **"Ready to ship" Slack alert** — Fired exactly once when all phases complete except the blocked gate. Deduped by the existence of the ship sidecar file.
- **`ShipSidecar` dataclass + atomic sidecar I/O** — Writes `outcomes/<tick_id>-ship.json` with PR details, head SHA, and branch names. Read by `approve` to verify SHA and complete the merge.
- **`approve_lock` via fcntl** — Serializes concurrent approve calls so two operators can't race the same merge.
- **`get_todo_kanban_tasks`** — Queries kanban for all tasks of a tick, returning `KanbanTaskInfo` with task IDs and statuses. Used by `approve` to resolve and complete the gate task.
- **`bump_in_pr`** — Writes VERSION, pyproject.toml, and CHANGELOG on the work branch, commits, and pushes. Restores the original branch after completion (even on failure).

### Changed
- **`Phase` dataclass** — `gate` flag added; `prompt`, `tools`, `turns` now optional with defaults so gate phases need no LLM fields.
- **`configs/phases.yaml`** — `phase_9_ship` added as a `gate: true` phase; `terminal: true` moved from Phase 8 to Phase 9.
- **`register_todo_phases`** — Gate phases are created with `--initial-status blocked` and no `--goal` flags (pure markers, never dispatched to an agent).
- **`_tick_project`** — Calls `maybe_ship_ready` before the `all_phases_complete` early-return, so the "ready to ship" alert fires even though the blocked gate keeps `all_phases_complete` returning False.

### Fixed
- **Branch left on `work_branch` after bump failure** — `bump_in_pr` wraps `git checkout work_branch` in try/finally that restores the original branch, so a CI-red refusal or merge failure doesn't leave the operator on the wrong branch.

## [Unreleased]
